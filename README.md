# Project: _Humanoid Robot Imitation of Human Motion from Instructional Videos_

Clone the repository
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManifoldFR/recvis-project
 ```

## Dependencies

The initial HMR repository uses Python 2.7 and TensorFlow 1.3. We patched HMR to be able to use more recent versions of Python and TensorFlow 1.x (tested on TensorFlow 1.15 and Python 3.7).
